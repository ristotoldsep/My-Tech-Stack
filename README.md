# My Tech Stack
---
List of the technologies and tools I have learned and used over time. Updating it as I progress.
### TLDR: 
Familiar with several languages/libraries/frameworks/platforms - Trying to master MERN stack & also Wordpress for faster development. Probably stronger in front-end, but aspiring to become an experienced full stack web developer.

## Web/Frontend
* HTML

* JavaScript/EcmaScript (vanilla) - Trying to keep up with new ES releases!
* Going to learn SCSS

*Libraries:*
* Bootstrap 3/4
* Semantic UI
* jQuery
* tachyons

*Frameworks:*
* React.js (Hooks, Redux etc...)

## Server/Backend
*Platforms:* 
* NodeJS - Package management: NPM
* PHP - mostly for WP development

*Frameworks:*
* Express.js
* Laravel - Slowly learning it to fix a client site.

## Databases
- MongoDB
- PostgreSQL

I have tried to use and implement both relational & non-relational databases and learn their query syntax. 

## Content Management Systems & Plugins
* WordPress
** WooCommerce etc...

I have created projects using Elementor, currently creating a theme and improving my ability to write PHP to manipulate the data of a WordPress site
and writing JavaScript to add interactivity.
Hoping to acquire the skills, knowledge and vocabulary to work professionally as a WordPress developer

### Development Environmets
* Visual Studio Code 
* goormIDE
* Visual Studio 2019/Geany - for C/C++

Actually have tried pretty much all code editors and environments, but nothing beats VsCode.

### Version control
* Git/Github 
* Bitbucket

### Hosting platform
* Heroku
* Netlify
* Github Pages
* SiteGround

### Deployment workflow
* Docker - still in the phase of figuring it out.

### Also experience in:

* VHDL

I am studying Computer Systems Engineering/Hardware Development and Programming in TalTech and these are the main languages we use. 

### Stuff I'm planning to master:
#### Module Bundlers
* WebPack
#### Testing
#### Workflow Automation

- Basically trying to become a senior-ish developer.
