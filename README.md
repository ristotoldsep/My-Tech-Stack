List of the technologies and tools I have learned and used over time. Updating it as I progress.
### TLDR: 
Familiar with several languages/libraries/frameworks/platforms - Trying to master MERN/PHP + MySQL stack & also Wordpress for freelance development. Probably stronger in front-end, but aspiring to become an experienced full stack web developer.

## Web/Frontend

## Server/Backend
*Platforms:*

## Databases
### Relational:

* Heroku (Unfortunately they cancelled their free tier)
* Netlify
* Github Pages

* Continuous Deployment from GitHub with DeployHQ & Netlify

### Stuff I'm planning to master:
#### Module Bundlers
* WebPack
* Parcel
#### Working with different APIs
#### Testing
* PHPUnit for PHP unit tests
#### Workflow Automation

- Basically trying to become a senior-ish developer & write clean, modular, reusable and maintanable code!
