# My Tech Stack
---
List of the technologies and tools I have learned and used over time. Updating it as I progress.
### TLDR: 
Familiar with several languages/libraries/frameworks/platforms - Probably stronger in front-end, but aspiring to become an experienced full stack web developer. 4 years of experience with PHP/Wordpress, also currently heavily focused on learning the React ecosystem + Headless CMS solutions and building projects with them.

## Web/Frontend
* HTML/JSX
* CSS (almost always using SCSS).
* JavaScript/Typescript - Trying to keep up with new ES releases and use types where possible.

*Libraries/Frameworks:*
* React.js (Hooks, Redux etc...)
* Gatsby js (React + GraphQL)
* Next.js
* Vue.js

* *Libraries:*
* Bootstrap 3/4
* Semantic UI
* jQuery
* tachyons
* Slick
* AOS
* GSAP
* ... Actually too many to list out

## Server/Backend
*Platforms:* 
* NodeJS - Package management: NPM
* PHP - WP development + Other projects | Package management: Composer

## Other languages:
* C/C++
* Java
* VHDL - I studied Computer Systems Engineering/Hardware Development and Programming in TalTech and these are the main languages we used. 
* Python (Done basic projects)
* Fortran

*Frameworks:*
* Express.js
* Laravel (Basics)

## Databases
### Relational:
- PostgreSQL/mySQL

### Non-relational/NoSQL:
- MongoDB
- Redis

I have tried to use and implement both relational & non-relational databases and learn their query syntax. 

## Content Management Systems & Plugins
* WordPress (Management, Creating themes & Plugins)
#### WooCommerce etc...

I have created 100+ websites & online stores,  developed themes & plugins, currently working professionally as a WordPress developer.

### Development Environmets
* Visual Studio Code 
* goormIDE
* Visual Studio 2019/Geany - for C/C++
* Xampp
* Local By Flywheel

Actually have tried pretty much all code editors and environments, but nothing beats VsCode.

### Version control
* Git/Github 
* Bitbucket

### Hosting platform
* Zone/Veebimajutus/Telia etc.
* Heroku (Unfortunately they cancelled their free tier)
* Netlify
* Vercel
* Github Pages
* SiteGround
* Gatsby cloud

### Deployment workflow
* Docker
* Continuous Deployment from GitHub with DeployHQ & Netlify

### Stuff I'm planning to master:
#### Module Bundlers
* WebPack
* Parcel
#### Working with different APIs
#### Testing
* Jest / React Testing Library
* PHPUnit for PHP unit tests
  
#### Workflow Tools
* gulp.js
* Laravel Mix
* Vite

- Basically trying to become a senior-ish developer & write clean, modular, reusable and maintanable code!
